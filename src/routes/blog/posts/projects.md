I believe in the open-source community because it helps people work together to create better software and solutions. Open-source projects allow developers to share their work freely, making technology more accessible to everyone. I appreciate how open source encourages learning and collaboration, enabling people to share knowledge and improve together.

The best way to learn programming is by building projects. When you work on real applications, you gain hands-on experience and solve problems that teach you valuable skills. Projects help you grow as a developer faster than going through the "tutorial hell."

## Honorable Mentions

### LMS

<p class="leading-7 px-8 text-lg text-justify md:px-3">
    During an online class, while chatting with a friend on Discord, I had a sudden inspiration. ðŸ’¡ Why not create a Discord Bot to automate online classes for educational organizations? This tool could streamline meetings, distribute assignments, and collect student work seamlessly. Excited by the idea, I pitched it to Mud, and we embarked on the project. Progress was slow, but we persisted. Building this <span class="text-blue-600 font-bold">Learning Management System</span> (LMS) on Discord taught us valuable skills in API integration and bot development. Although the project is currently <span class="text-red-600">discontinued</span>, it remains dear to me, like the middle child.

    PrimeQuiz is a social media trivia app where users can create trivia questions and answer them to gain points. I developed this app for a competition and was thrilled to win first place!

### Portfolio with Blog

<p class="leading-7 px-8 text-lg text-justify md:px-3">
    The project you are currently exploring is an overcomplicated portfolio with a blog page. This project showcases my work, skills, and thoughts in a structured and visually appealing manner. Developing this portfolio helped me hone my skills in web development, design, and content creation. I aimed to create a platform where I could share my journey and connect with like-minded individuals in the tech community.
