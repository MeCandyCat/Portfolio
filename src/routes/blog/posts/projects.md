I believe in the open source community because it helps people work together to make better softwares and solutions. Open source projects let developers share their work freely, which makes technology more accessible to everyone. I like how open source encourages learning and collaboration, where people can share knowledge and improve together.

The best way to learn programming is by building projects. When you work on real applications, you learn hands-on and solve problems that teach you valuable skills. Projects help you grow as a developer faster than going through the "tutorial hell".

## Honnerable Mentions

# LMS

<p class="leading-7 px-8 text-lg text-justify md:px-3">
    I was in an online class, casually chatting with a friend on Discord, when inspiration struck
    me like a bolt of lightning. ðŸ’¡ Why not create a Discord Bot
    to automate online classes for educational organizations? This tool could streamline meetings,
    distribute assignments, and collect student work seamlessly. Excited, I pitched the idea to
    Mud, and we embarked on the project. Progress was slow, but we persisted. Building this
    <span class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-900 font-bold">Learning Management System</span>
    in Discord (LMS) taught us valuable skills in API integration and bot development. Although the
    project is currently <span class="text-red-600 dark:text-red-900">discontinued</span>, it
    remains in heart like the middle child.
